# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Model
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module provides a simple proof-of-concept implementation of a PINN.
# A PINN is a neural network that is trained to solve supervised learning
# tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general
# nonlinear partial differential equations.
#
# In this example, we solve a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):
#   dy/dx = -y
# with the boundary condition:
#   y(0) = 1
# The analytical solution is y = exp(-x), which we can use to verify our model.
#
# This simple model can be extended to more complex manufacturing problems,
# such as optimizing material flow or predicting machine wear, by defining
# a more sophisticated loss function that represents the underlying physics
# of the system.
